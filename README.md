# hello-world
Me learning how to use GitHub
I'm a 18 year old student from Switzerland learning how to code. I started with khan academy. Now I'm working through colt steeles Web Developer Bootcamp (47 hours video material!). I'm also very interested in Design using the adobe creative cloud. My goal is to become a fullstack Developer and Entepreneur and have the skills necessary to make the world a better place.
